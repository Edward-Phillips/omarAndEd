# Omar and Ed Side Project

This side project is focused on solving the following problem:
```
    As a Mystery Plant Vendor,
    So that I can ensure I do not send the same plants to customers,
    I want to see a list of all the previous plants a customer has received.
```

## APPROACH

We initially met to discuss the project and agree on what the minimum requirements were for achieving the user story above.
The discussion is documented in this [google sheets page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zhsNf9LTrIru8npv_Uir75j1ggfLR-4IB-d4-AY1HlU/edit#gid=0)

## Frontend

The frontend is a react app, for more information view the [frontend README](/frontend/README.md)

## ROADMAP

The MVP of this project will have the following features:

- Save a customer
- Save a plant
- Save an Order of Plants that a Customer has made
- See what Plants a Customer has Ordered in the past.

Future features are listed below (not in prioritised order):

- track Stock of current Plant inventory
- track price of Orders to track income
- track cost of goods of Orders to calculate gross profit
- use Stock and Orders to calculate what Plants are in Stock that the Customer has not had in past Orders.
